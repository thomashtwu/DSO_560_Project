I have regularly gone to Disney World since it opened in 1971 and all of us in this group have even been to Disney Paris. All 5 of us noticed the level of service and professionalism at this park was lacking. ( ages 55  23 ) Won't go again. For $155 for a one day Park hopper you should expect Disney service. It was not the happiest place on earth. There was nothing special about this visit. The park seemed more like a Six Flags property rather than a Disney property. \n",

      "100.0% If you have been to other Disneyland Parks in other countries, you would be disappointed with the size and the attractions in HK Disneyland. Its a lot smaller than other Disneyland Parks (Paris, Orland, Tokyo are the ones I've seen) and the rides are quite few. We went on a Tuesday where foot traffic was quite low and got there at 10am. We rode all of the rides and visited all attractions and managed to finish everything by 5pm. Note that this includes 10 30mins wait for each ride. The parade was scheduled at 7:30pm then fireworks follows at 8pm. We didn't wait for both. We just wanted to go home since there's nothing else to see. Just to add, it also has the smallest sleeping beauty's castle that looked more like a prop that a real castle. On another note, my nieces who were Disneyland first timers loved the experience. I guess HK Disneyland works for kids and for Disney first timers.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "100.0% Disneyland is no longer the happiest place on earth but it is one of the most expensive. A two day pass for a family of four is close to $1000. The lines are long and the employees are no longer happy to be there. A 10 hour visit yields 7 rides. Save your money and take the kids to the beach. He'll enjoy it just as much\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "100.0% First let me say that I was in Anaheim on business and had exactly one evening to attend the park Sunday April 6. I assumed since kids were in school and we were not near a holiday the park would be bearable. Unfortunately, everyplace was packed. I was not even able to find the end of the line at Space Mountain. (probably would have spent the evening in line if I did ). Several of the rides that I wanted to go on were closed   Small world, submarines...The park in the evening was dimly lit (not sure if they do this to conserve energy !). Yes , too dimly to even be able to read a map. Surprisingly, we did not see ONE disney character (I don't know did we not do our homework ?..we did not see the parade). Some rides are shut down when fireworks are on..further limiting our rides. So my advice to all is PLAN PLAN PLAN and research the days you are going. Look to see what is closed. Look at less congested days (if they exist) and certainly take advantage of all fast passes that you can get. I don't believe it is even possible to do everything in the park on one day. (that explains multi day packages !).\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "100.0% Been going to Disneyland since I was a little kid. Every year the ticket prices go up and the lines get longer. This time we were so shocked at how many rides kept going out of service all weekend. We paid over $700.00 for tickets for two adults and two kids for 2 days. After paying for parking and food and a few shirts I'm sure it cost me at least 1000.00 bucks. So many people were in the park it was hard to even walk around. Long lines for food, rides and bathrooms. Fast passes ran out quick and were not available. We spent so much time walking around trying to get on rides that were either out of service when we got there or went out of service while we were in line. Indiana jones, haunted mansion, Astro boasters, space mountain, cars, scream and big thunder railroad are just some of the rides that had technical problems and were closed off and on. Just not fun to stand in line for 40 min to have them announce  Sorry we are having technical problems and the ride is temporarily closed . No other information is given. Could be closed 5 min or 5 hours. I have never experienced this in all the years of going to Disneyland. I remember thinking as we were waiting for over 2 hours in line for the cars ride how we must all be brain washed to pay 700.00 to stand in lines all day and think it's somehow fun. Don't think we will return until they limit the number of people that are let in the park each day. Just not worth the price they are charging anymore. \n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "100.0% When it comes to Disneyland, there are three types of people. The people who love Disney, no matter what their age. The people who are doing the obligatory  taking the kids trip,  and the people who are never going. That being said, anyone who is reading reviews isn't doing so to decided whether or not to go, they're reading it for the tips. I fall into the second to third category of people but am happy to share my recent experience to make someone else's better. We went for 2 days with the husbands kids and grandkids here are a couple of pointers and things I found.First, download the Disneyland App and also pay the extra (I think it was $40 for the hubs and I for 2 days) for the Max Pass. This allows you to do multiple things. First, you can book Fast Passes from your phone rather than having to walk to the ride and then come back at a certain time. Also, it allows you to have multiple Fast Passes at a time and let's you know when you are eligible to book your next one. Other cool features are that it let's you connect and keep all of your pictures in one place, let's you book food or restaurant reservations, gives you wait times for all of the rides for both Disney and California Adventure and tells you where characters are appearing and at what times. You can also keep you tickets on your phone so you don't have to worry about paper tickets. Honestly, the app was the biggest 'Hidden Gem' of the park. We were there on a Sunday and Monday and it was packed. It didn't help that it was Gay Pride, Canadian Thanksgiving and Columbus day all at the same time. As a result, the park was at max capacity both days. What I found helpful was starting about a week before, check the app and note the popular rides. When you first get into the park, go straight to one of them and then start Fastpassing a second a third. Due to the amount of people in the park, this was the only way we got to do the rides we wanted. Also, I would say 8 12 is your best opportunity to wait in the shortest lines. By noon both days, Fastpasses were 'sold out' and lines were 1 2 hours long. Even trying to get pictures with characters was 1 2 1 hour long wait times.Don't take kids younger than 6! We were there with a 3 and 5 year old and it seemed overwhelming for them and like they didn't quite get it. They weren't super into the rides (if at all) So it was a lot of eating a shopping and doing smaller things. It's a lot of money to pay for the kids not to get the full experience. Not saying all kids will be like this but in general, it seemed that way for the younger ones. Pack the least amount of stuff with you as possible. Hubs and I didn't even take bags in. Just phones, and sunglasses. He wore cargo pants to carry Id's a CC's and I wore cheap sunglasses so I wouldn't have to worry about them getting damaged or lost. This helped for getting through security and also with rides and the amount of people. Less is more. If you have kids and need to take bags etc, just take the minimum of what you need. The one item I recommend, especially if you are using the app is an extra battery charger and cord. I have a $30 Anker charger I got from Amazon that gives your phone about 5 charges and is pretty small to pack. You will be taking pics and using your phone with the app so you'll want to keep it charged. Disney has a few Kiosks where you can rent a charger but it was about $30 of a charge. Do yourself a favor and bring your own. Plan on dropping some coin, especially if you have kids. Disney ears alone were $30 a piece and I don't think we had a meal that was less than $30 for 2 people and we are just talking sandwiches and chips. The balloons were $15 plus each and with a couple of kids it adds up fast. Last year, the hubs and I did a three week Europe trip and spent $2500 total and we could have easily spent more than that for a few days in Disney. Go in knowing everything is expensive and make a budget of what you are and are not willing to pay for. Finally, stay off the property. We stayed about a 10 minute walk away but some other family members opted to stay at the Disneyland Grand Hotel. While the location is great, you are basically paying $600 plus a night to shorten your walk and maybe get a few other things (that you have to pay extra for). For example, my husbands daughter paid to have the room decorated. It was cool because it looked like Mickey had been there and the kids got a few keepsakes but other than that it was a basic double hotel room with about a 5 minute shorter walk to the entrance of the park. For us, staying a 10 minute walk away, we saved several thousand dollars got away from the crowds for a bit and got breakfast with our room which saved us from spending breakfast money in the park. The last time I was in Disney was 2000 and I remember it being far more fun and magical. To me it seems like an over priced and over crowded tourist trap but also if you have kids or grand kids, a necessary evil at least once. At this point I can say it's been checked off my bucket list and I don't need to go back. Read as much as you can and get as many 'Pro Tips' as possible to make your visit easy and fun.\n",

      "100.0% Ok. So Disneyland is for kids right? Well we are all big kids really... and Disneyland is still a relatively fund day out for adults. Starting with the positives, the mine train ride is awesome, Space Mountain is pretty cool, plus there is a good brunch in one of the hotels, where you can high five Pluto and hang out with Goofy. The downsides... 1) The park is pretty small 2) The castle is about the same size as a normal suburban house and 3) this is for kid's fundamentally!\n",

      "48.71% Drove from Texas 20 hours in the car with 5 kids to visit what was once one of my favorite places. Arrived at the park to find 3 of the best rides closed with no advance notice. 3 of the rides broke down while we were in line adding a min of 45 minutes to our wait on each ride. Staff is still super friendly but the park is tired and old ..Spent $900 on tickets and it just wasnt worth it.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "100.0% My best trip to Disneyland was when my oldest daughter was 3 1 2. It was truly magic. Ten years later, we had another great trip with all the kids.Many years later, I was looking forward to a magical trip with the oldest of my oldest. The princess parts were, but it was otherwise a very mixed experience. The crowds were absurdly big (and I was told they were far worse the day before.) The waits on several rides were in excess of two hours; without Fast Pass it would have been insane. However, several rides stopped using Fast Pass late in the afternoon despite still having a two hour wait.In my previous trips, one could easily visit two thirds of the park in a day. We barely visited a quarter, due entirely to crowds.Another huge issue was the non notified closure of Fantasmic! (Seriously, there were no signs anywhere indicating this.) This is SUMMER folks, and you close a chunk of the park including a fantastic show. Worse, later the fireworks were cancelled due to high altitude wind conditions. I'm puzzled why they couldn't have had a partial show of low altitude fireworks (surely they've planned for such a thing.)While I understand the tie between Star Wars and Disney, why would the Frozen show and several meet the princess events be in California Adventures? Why tear up a huge chunk of the park for even more Start Wars? Why not just rename California Adventures to Star War Adventures and relocate it all there?The park seems dirtier and grungier than it did in the past. This isn't just more trash everywhere, but it seemed like cuts had been made to routine maintenance.The biggest difference I noticed is the professionalism of some park employees, The interactive performing employees were exemplary as were most of the rest, but several were far from helpful. (It's not all their fault. In one case an employee was desperately trying to get a line under control. I asked here why she didn't have a sign or anything else. She said she was supposed to have one, but wasn't given one.)As always, the food was over expensive and mixed in quality. That was expected. What I didn't expect was to see serving areas to be understaffed and oblivious resulting in people waiting in line without being assisted, orders being wrong and food places being closed until after the posted opening time.In short, there is a serious problem with service at Disneyland. I'm sure part of this are budget cuts, but it's far more likely a management problem.I have no desire to return, though with another grandchild on the way, I'm sure that will change. Hopefully, Disney will fix many of the issues I saw and it will become magical again.PS. The Haunted Mansion is in desperate need of a makeover. Splash mountain could also use an update  nothing big, just replacing the characters and songs with something else.\n",

      "100.0% Its a fun day out, however there were too many people there, mainly China mainland tour group. I think also you don't want to go during the school holidays as Im told the crowds are huge. Considering how long ago this park opened, I think there should be more attractions. Like most amusement parks there is a height minimum for the kids to go on some rides. Overall a good day when we went which was on the first weekday just after the school holidays in 2014. We will go back again for sure and see what has changed if any.\n",

      "100.0% First off, I'm a huge Disneyland fanatic. I live out of state and only have managed to go about 9xs (not enough!). However, this trip Oct 9 Oct 11 was one of the least pleasant visits we ever had. We have been to DL on 3 major holidays and we never have seen it as packed as we did during this visit. I mean shoulder to shoulder crowds, 20 min to get from New Orleans to Frontierland, can't put your kid down without him getting stepped on, packed! All rides were 45 min to over 2 hours wait. Fastpasses were gone by 12pm. We went about 45 min before the park opened at 8am and we didn't get in until 10am! Parking was a nightmare as well as the security checkpoint. I heard that since DL has made annual passes more accessible, the crowds have been too difficult to deal with. And I feel this takes away from the whole magic of the park. We spend thousands of dollars to go wait in line for over an hour for a ride, 20 min for a churro, what kid wants to do that? We couldn't ride the Tower of Terror for the last time due to only one elevator running and the over 2 hour wait (no fast passes). Radiator Springs racers also had a 2 hour wait but we beelined one morning and made it with only a 20 min wait. Don't even go into Tomorrowland, you can't push a stroller through. It makes you wonder what would happen in a disaster, how many people would get stomped on? Now the good... DL sure treats you right. We were 2 hours late to our Character dining at the Plaza Inn with Minnie (security lines) and they still managed to squeeze us in. Also, the travel agency we used didn't send the e voucher on time and DL gave us 4 complementary 1 day park hoppers no questions asked! Amazing! (we resolved the problem later) Let's talk about World of Color. That show made the entire trip worth it! It was so amazing I even got emotional watching it. We got fast passes when we did that beeline to Radiator Springs Racers and they are so worth it since you watch from the front row. This is a must see in your life. Mickeys Soundsational Parade was also amazing and a nice break from the hectic day. My toddler fell for Tiana! Another thing we noticed is that there were characters everywhere and at all times. We had never seen this before. Out of the 9 previous visits we had never ever seen Mickey Mouse. We saw him 4 times! And finally Radiator Springs. Oh my goodness! It's a trip straight into the movie! Very well done Disney! 5 stars for Cars Land! Oh we also noticed that food in CA Adventures is significantly cheaper than DL. Plus they have alcohol (Rita's Margaritas anyone?) We enjoyed our time at CA Adventures more than DL in the end. I hope DL fixes this crowed mess, I doubt it since they are rolling in the dough. \n",

I have no reason why people need to keep bumping the person in front of them in line. You take time to save a spot for the parade and rude people come in at the last second trying to squeeze in.

      "100.0% I bought a few annual passes for my kid thinking about the experience I had 10 years ago.I used to take my daughter to Disneyland for 3 4 years with annual passes and it was very nice.However, many things have changed. The good 1. My kid still likes going to Disneyland.2. It is a safe place. The bad 1. The price is very expensive.(I believe $92 for a single day visit.)  The food price inside the Park is also very expensive.2. It is very crowded. It is packed with people. The wait for a ride is very long.  Maybe because it is during the spring break season. The ugly 1. The attitude of many employees is almost beaurocratic that you are one of many who just come and go. I had to show my ID 4 or 5 times because it was not updated  for 3 days after my face shot was taken. They could take the picture of you when you  purchase the pass but they wanted to save a few seconds of their time. I had to wait  in line to have my picture taken twice. 2. The management turned the Park into a money making machine. The food price is  very expensive and poor in quality inside the Park.My recommendation is to avoid peak seasons and weekends if you have to visit here and have meals before you come to the Park or bring your food to a picnic area just outside the Park.(You can get your hand stamped and come back after your visi to the picnic area.)\n",

It is obviously set up for young people but very little for older big kids like us. It is relatively new and we did notice that there were more attractions being built but on this day not a lot that attracted us. The train trip there was easy so no problem there.\n",

      "100.0% We were in town for a couple days and bought a couple single day park hopper passes at about 10PM from our hotel on Oct 21 for use on Oct 22. We were sold on the idea to add MaxPass to the tickets to help with Fastpass lines. I ordered Maxpass using the App 1030PM Oct 21 for both our passes. When we got to the park, the app said we had to buy the max passes again. Tried to buy again and still didn't work. I phoned in and was on hold for 9 min at 9:49am and again at 10:56 for another 9 min and called again and finally got through. I was told they couldn't refund the charges on the phone and that I had to visit park guest services. This is totally unreasonable. I spent 45 min lining up and visiting guest services to explain. They were suggesting that it may be a problem with my phone or the signal. 5 other people were complaining at the same time. It seemed to be the only complaint that day. Why not just admit it's not working, sincerely apologize and offer an immediate and prompt refund. They finally refunded me after much wasted time and unnecessary discussions. The next day, Oct 23, my credit card was charged again for another $20.00 but I had deleted the app so I can't figure out how or why we were charged again? I call in today Oct 24 to complain (another 15 min on the phone, transfer to a supervisor, etc) and was told I should get a refund back in a couple weeks latest but to keep checking. A good business would extend an offer at a minimum of an instant refund (not one that takes hours of complaining and time on hold to receive). Since it took hours to conclude, Id also extend an offer a courtesy comp pass for the next visit to make up for the inconvenience. No such customer service experience with Disneyland. Walt Disney's legacy was the creation of what most humans think of as the happiest place on earth. He left that legacy in the hands of management to maintain and uphold. My opinion is that responsibility is sacred and that Disney Corp needs to consider this when making policy and procedures. Sometimes you need to let your staff be human and deal with issues as they see fit but I get the feeling staff have their hands tied or are poorly trained about customer service. I understand that certain policy is in place to prevent abuse of your system but it can be a double edge sword when a policy is too cumbersome, rigid and firm, you will end up hurting your good customers and turning your staff into subservient robots insincerely spouting canned speech language about how disingenuously sorry they are for your trouble. \n",

There are only two or three rides that are suitable for the older 'kids'   the run away train and Space Mountain. Don't get me wrong we had a good time but it wasn't like Dreamworld in Aus which is suitable for all ages. The optimum age would be anywhere from little children to young teens.As two adults I probably wouldn't go back unless we took our child with us. You can definitely get around in half a day easily.Couple of things that were disappointing, many of the restaurants were closed and some of the sections were closed or closing early for the day.\n",

That being said, it's Disneyland, and that alone is worth the the trip. Everyone participates in  magic morning,  so go early and expect to wait. You can get a lot in if you are an early riser  but there will be some wait for most rides. You can get Fast Passes, but not for nearly as many rides as Disney World. We really enjoyed the Indiana Jones ride and the older  dark Disney  rides. I wasn't able to get on Peter Pan  the line was always at least 45 minutes. The Nemo ride is horrible and not worth the long wait.\n",

Unfortunately for us it didn't reach our expectations due to parts of the park closing early unexpectedly and many of the rides being closed or breaking down on the day we visited. Don't get me wrong we had a great day anyway but due to the expensive admission and expectations we had, it was a bit of a disappointment (especially the Micky Tootown part of the park closing 2 hours before normal closure, as no one told us this would be the case). I would still recommend Disneyland to friends but i would advise them to ask about park closing times so that they could plan their day around early closures and for them not to have massive expectations of the world famous park.\n",

Line ups were at least 1 1 2 hrs after 10am, so starting early is a must. Several rides broke down when we were the next up to get on. No compensation even though we used a fastpass for the ride and wasted several hours waiting to use it. If you're not into the parade   go to the other park before it starts! You can't move anywhere while the parade is on. There's simply too many people. This is a good time to get onto rides as the lineups are smaller. There are Disney staff on every corner, so getting directions and help was easy. Although it was crazy we had a good time   the key is learning to be patience.\n",

Upon boarding California screaming rollercoaster, the safety restraint system was pushed down and caught my camera bag. The strap on my bag pulled accross my throat and started choking me at which time I started yelling to the ride operators to stop the ride. They clearly heard me but chose not to stop the ride. It was only because people in line started screaming that the ride operator came over and released the restraint system. While I appreciate that things can happen on the rides given the number of people that visit disney, I am disappointed at the response I received when I complained. No one seemed interested in addressing my concern. Disney would not take my name or phone number to follow up on my concern. They will not even provide a phone number to speak with someone regarding any concerns that you may have with the park. While I have enjoyed disney parks in the past we will not be returning based on the way they handled my concern. \n",

      "100.0% Sad. . . . Really Disney??? I read and updated myself before coming to Disneyland on disability services. My last visit was 10 years ago. This was to be my first visit using a scooter. (I can't walk long distances or stand for long periods) and, to Celebrate my granddaughters second birthday. I did what was advised, went to city hall and was met with,  What is your PROBLEM today?  From there, it just got worse. These are just the highlights of what I encountered throughout my one day visit. I am saddened that I was met with cast members who spoke to me like I was a child! I had a party of two adults (me  53yrs old, my daughter 22yrs old and one 2 year old) I have a positive attitude, am courteous, educated, speak well and pride myself on my communication skills. My  simple  question was met with  scolding  tones. I asked the Indiana Jones Ride attendant for procedures and was told,  If YOU are going to ride then . . . I was confused by his tone. Yes, I was the rider. I had help (my daughter) to transfer, but, we also had a two year old who couldn't ride, so tell me what we need to do . . . It became such a production, I left and didn't ride. I was invisible to the store clerks in Frontierland who was more involved with their profit sharing conversation and displeasure with the disney company to notice I needed help. I was walked along the whole perimeter of the Blue Bayou restaurant, when I could have easily been taken a shorter way. (I was told it was  company policy ) I found it insulting the host didn't even wait for me to arrive at the table. They show more care at IHOP. Andy, the manager (who was very apologetic and sweet) gave me a fast pass for Peter Pan to turn my bad experience around, but I really should have left. Blue Bayou was my kids  Treat  meal, I wanted to continue the tradition with my granddaughter, but for a restaurant that boasts excellent food and service that first encounter taught me, you can't relive your past. Disney, the icing on the cake was Fantasmic. I did everything I was supposed to. Got my fastpass early. Yellow section to boot. I checked at 5p with the yellow jacket personnel on where to line up and was told,  You line up here at 630p, not at 615p, not at 625p, but 630pm  Really? So i guess the 50  people who were there at 615p wasn't as fortunate as me to get her memo. BUT that most demeaning, degrading and icing on my cake of disappointment was the attendant who directed me back to the  Handicapped  section, and seated me directly in front of the lamp post. When I tired to explain that my view was being blocked, he cut me off and pretty much told me, he had more people to concern himself with. I spoke with manager after that. Disney, you broke me. Disappointed me. Made me feel like I was a bad child and punished me for being in a scooter. I held my tongue and disappointment for my daughter and granddaughter's sake, but I did the research! I followed the rules!!! We came during  off peak  season, as not to battle the crowds. we paid the same admission price for shorter park hours, but that was the trade off. My sacrifices were for nothing. I will be back, but the next time I will be better prepared, grow a tougher skin, fend for myself and tell everyone I know, my beloved Disney sees you through different eyes when you are on wheels. Even my letter of  concern  was met with a FORM letter of apology and a sincerely worded phone call apology, and then I'm sure was promptly filed in the trash can. Did it get to tghose who could make a difference? Highly doubt it. Even Sadder.\n",

      "After visiting Disneyland Paris and The Universal Studios in Singapore, Disneyland Hong Kong was not so great. The attractions are mainly for kids and even the 'most extreme' are never so exciting. Some of them were under maintenance and the 'soldier parachute' was still being tested at 12.00pm which is unacceptable for those who pay a 1 day ticket.The worst was Star Wars attraction which is basically nothing compared to the Transformers attraction at the Universal Studios. They only used some projections and lights, no high speed, no 3D or 4D effects!If you want to take a picture with Disney characters you have to queue for longtime..why don't they hire more staff to represent Disney characters and let them walk around so everybody can have the chance to take a pic?? At Disneyland Paris we took a lot of pics and the characters walked around at any time! I love Disney world but I think this Disneyland should definitely improve.\n",

      "I have just spent the day with my family at HK Disneyland, and my overall impression of the place was average. I was staying in Hong Kong for a few days, and deliberately delayed my visit to Disneyland till the Monday to avoid the crowds. However, that didn't seem to help much.Having visited Universal Studios Singapore a few times, I would say that Disneyland Hong Kong is not as good. Universal sells a Fastpass which allows you to skip the queues on all the rides for an additional fee, however, the Disney Fastpass is only available for 2 rides, and works somewhat differently.The average wait time per attraction was 40 60 mins, and the park seemed to be bursting at the seams. Waiting 1 hour with 2 small kids for a 3 minute ride is not fun. The park itself is not massive and can be easily completed in one day. The food at the park is very expensive and the quality is not great. Hong Kong Disneyland is one of those theme parks that you will visit once on a holiday to Hong Kong, but it's not one of those places you would return to in a hurry.\n",

      "It was my childhood dream to visit a Disneyland Park. So I was very excited to visit the park along with my wife and two sons. However I was a bit disappointed with the overall experience.Maybe I had high expectations from this big international brand! Also since we had earlier visited the Universal Studios in Singapore we were expecting a similar or better experience.However, the Disney park was extremely crowded when we visited on a weekday. Every ride had a minimum of 50 minute wait time with long serpentine queues. Hence we could only experience 5 6 rides. Some of the visitors from Mainland China were extremely in disciplined and line cutting was a common site everywhere. These people travel in large numbers with only one person waiting in the queue and then a dozen others joining that one person as he reaches near the ride. Disneyland claims that it will not allow outside food but to our surprise we found many of the visitors enjoying outside and home cooked food. We enjoyed the Disney Parade and the Lion King Show. Also the firework display which starts at 8 pm is very good. Some tips  It is advisable to buy your disney tickets in advance from either the Disney Hotels (if you are staying in one) or from the Disney outlet on the Avenue of Stars at Tsim Sha Tsui. This way you will save a precious 1 hour wait time at the ticket counter in the Park. Besides on every ticket you will get a small gift (bag tags, etc) at the Disney store on the Avenue of Stars.  While visiting the park with toddlers, its best to carry your own pram as renting one at the park costs HK$100.  If you are staying at the Disney Hotels then do not waste your time in shopping for Disney merchandise at the Park as there is a Disney store with the entire range of merchandise located in these Disney Hotels.  Plan to watch the Lion King show when you are tired walking around or if its raining. As the show is held indoors  Do NOT waste your time queuing up for the Autopedia ride. Its not worth it!  Try to be near the castle (the main roundabout) by around 3.15 pm as the Disney Parade starts by 3.30 pm\n",

      "I had great expectations of Disneyland, this being my first visit to a Disney Park. I've been to Universal Studios Singapore before and was enthralled by it.

But hey, its still a Disney Park and a fun way to spend your day. Do check out the cool shows, the Mickey shaped waffles at Main Street USA and do not miss the night parade with Alladin's  I can show you the world  theme, its truly magical!\n",

      "I have been here before and it was just not the same. The crowds are much bigger and the wait is too long. There are no trees so there is no shelter from the hot sun! The staff are not as friendly as they used to be and they did not try to understand that the temperatures were high and they could easily have hurried the pace between rides if they managed it properly. Also they never filled up all the rides and a lot of rides had only two or three people where 4 or 5 could easily have gone. The only good thing was they had a fast tract where you could punch your ticket and were given a time to come back for that particular ride. Though the time given was 4 or 5 hours after it still meant that we did not have to wait under the hot sun.The parade only starts at 7:30 PM and the light show at 9 PM!!!We were there from 1000 AM and there was no way our children could stay awake that late.They should look at having these two much earlier.\n",

      "We visited Disneyland with our 12 year old son. He enjoyed a lot, but not much to see. Very few rides and it's just a fun filled outing. It's not worth to stay inside Disneyland, as one day is more than enough to look around. It is just a mini Disneyland. Don't miss the parade which starts around 7.30 pm, it's really amazing to watch all Disney characters walk around. Overall it would be fun for kids going for the first time.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "After reading the reviews, my expectations were pretty low, so maybe that helped!I just got back from visiting today, it was friggen hot as all hell, humid as could be, and smoggy as Hong Kong has become, but there was a breeze, so that was nice...Anyway, I went alone (what a loser am I) and with the single rider lines for Space Mountain and the Runaway Mine Cars in Grizzly Gulch or whatever it's called, I actually felt like a VIP. I never waited for more than a few minutes and usually ended up with a little kid or a mom whose husband had the kid in their car, or with some other third wheel from the standby lines. I also seen some people  pretending  to be single riders (they were holding hands until the employees running the ride were around, then played it  cool ) so I think you could beat the system that way if you want. I also seen a parade and all the Disney characters...and I think that Disney does a pretty good job with their princess selection...man, they all looked just like the ones in LA! I think they all could do a good job of making my dreams come true someday! haha!And since I was just at Disneyland Anaheim this year too, I can say that HK doesn't match up, but it was a fun way to spend most of my day rather than wander around and see the same old crap in Kowloon the day before I head into China... I took the train from Tsim Sha Tsui (red line) to Lai King and xferred to the orange line to Sunny Bay, then to the Disney line, and it was a pretty easy trip, maybe 40 minutes...I had a good time, probably won't go back, but I can cross it off the list. Next visit to HK, I'll try Ocean Park and see how that one rates...hopefully it'll be cooler the next time I come over here!\n",

      "Obviously I haven't visited Hong Kong Disneyland myself, but it doesn't take a genius to deduce from the final attractions list that this ISN'T the Disneyland we all know and love. This park is distinctly lacking in attractions... and lands.There are only 4 actual moving rides: The Jungle Cruise (slow moving boat ride), The Many Adventures of Winnie The Pooh (slow moving dark ride), Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters (slow moving dark ride), and Space Mountain (high speed family coaster). So, not much to do for those craving excitement or thrills.There is no Pirates of the Carribean, no Big Thunder Mountain, no Haunted Mansion, no Indiana Jones Adventure, no Splash Mountain, no Peter Pan's Flight, no It's A Small World, no Star Tours, and no Autopia. Yes, you will find none of these attractions in Hong Kong Disneyland.There's also no Frontierland. What? Yes, Frontierland has been completely obliterated from the park, leaving only 4 lands: Main Street USA, Adventureland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland. Great.\n",

      "There were only about two rides in each of the lands areas and several of those rides were closed. The park is small and so each of the rides are compacted into small spaces. The rides were short. The best show was the Lion King, Moana was disappointing. The lines were only 15 30 minutes waiting time. It's about $80 to get in. They have cooked squid they sell at kiosks and it tastes like beef jerky. You can take the subway to get to Disneyland\n",

      "Disneyland has a very good business model. They have very good service. But they know how to squeeze every cent off visitors. I spent my whole time there on a hot June weekday and found some ways to save money and enjoy more on weekdays. Here are some reflections as I felt cheated by the business model after my trip:1. The park tends to very crowded in the late morning and early afternoon. This is because most tour groups arrive in the morning and families and youths on holiday tend to go there during these hours. It is hence hardly surprisingly that all the exciting rides or plays take around 20 to 30 minutes waiting time. It is very frustrating when the weather is hot and you will waste a lot of time waiting.2. But I notice something after 4pm. From 4pm, I notice the wait times for the exciting rides were reduced to 5 to 10 minutes for most stations. This is because most of tour groups and students have left. You get a chance to enjoy the stations. More importantly, you avoid the queue and the weather is better around that time. 3. At around 5pm, I notice new entertainment appears. They are people singing on the streets and some new disney characters will suddenly in the evening. Moreover, there is a fireworks display at 7.30pm. I think they are trying to encourage people to spend more and stay in their hotel. Hence, they provide a different set of entertainment to attract this customers to book their overpriced hotels. 4. Another reason why Disneyland has a good business model is the over priced food. A single scoop of ice cream can cost HK $50. Their concept diners and self run fast food chains serve bland burgers at exuberant prices. The taste is not unique from food you can buy in other areas in Hong Kong. Moreover, the queue is very long and frustrating under the hot June weather. As a result, perhaps it is better to go after your lunch. You can avoid the queue and save money on food.5. I made a terrible mistake to buy the tickets online before I go Disneyland. I notice the ticket prices are cheaper when you buy at the Disneyland counter. 6. There are many souvenir shops to attract you to buy more. Some of the shops sell items not found in other souvenir shops. My advice is do window shopping first at the 2 main shops near the entrance. You take note of the prices of things you are interested in and don't buy first. Reason is because you have to walk pass those shops again before you leave. So you can buy later. Moreover, it prevents impulse buying because you may find nicer souvenirs at other souvenir shops in Disney theme park. Please bring your own plastic bag as plastic bags in shops are chargeable.7. There are many areas you can take photos with your favourite characters. But each photo is around HK $200. There is an unlimited package at HK$298 that is recommended and worth it. You can go for that as you can print unlimited photos. Through my learning experiences, my recommendation is to go around 2pm after a heavy lunch. You buy the tickets from the ticket counter at Disneyland. After you reach around 2pm, you avoid stations that are popular among youths. You visit performances like Mickey Mouse Awards as there are air con and can hold more people. At around 4pm after you watch the performances, buy sourvenirs and take photos with your disney characters, you will then visit all the exciting rides. This will allow you to save a lot of time on waiting as wait time will be cut around 5 to 10 minutes for most rides. You should complete all the rides by 7.20pm and appreciate the evening activities propping up. After that you can proceed for the 7.30pm parade and fireworks. That will end your day and just in time for dinner outside Disneyland. This programme will help you to save money and time. It will also beat the well crafted Disneyland business model.\n",

      "We have been to Disneyland in Anaheim and it is much bigger than this one. That said the parade that they have in the afternoon was spectacular and there has been no expense spared. The best rides are Space Mountain and the RC racer in Toy Story Land.I expected the food to be expensive but $105HK ( which is $21AUD) for 3 Mickey Mouse ice creams is ridiculous. The gifts in the gift stores didn't seem too overly priced. We got the 2 day pass and we went back on the second day in the afternoon thinking it may be quieter   it wasn't. The longest we waited was 30 minutes in a line but most of the wait time was 5 to 10 minutes. My daughter is 11 and she really enjoyed the day and that is what we all go to Disneyland for. \n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "Disneyland   happiest place on earth? Well HK Disney is a bit of a disappointment.To start with getting into the place takes 30 minutes as they have to check every single bag. When you have thousands waiting to get in, then the queues they provide is certainly not enough. Imagine having kids excitedly wanting to get in, only to have to queue at the front entrance for 30 45 minutes.Also if you didn't buy your tickets online, you will also have to queue to purchase the tickets first. Lucky we bought ours online, but the ticket printing machine printed only 5 of our tickets when we have bought 6.The HK Disney is smaller than the US Disney, so there are fewer rides and less things to do once you are in the park.Most of the rides require at least 30 minutes of waiting time. On the day we were there, the weather bureau issued a typhoon 3 warning, and as a result they shut down all the outdoor rides. However during the entire day we were there, there was hardly a breeze. The management should be a bit more flexible and reopen some of the rides as there was no risk or danger. The only plus is that the Lion King show is worth a visit. Also you can buy Disney merchandise at the HK International airport so if you must get the Disney toys, there is an alternative.Also food and drinks are very expensive in there. Another minus is the some of the visitors from the mainland have no clues on what a queue is and their children just cut into the queues. Save your money and go to other Disneyland if you must.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "I wish I could give 3 1 2 stars because that would be more accurate. However, this is a hard review because there are some positives, but there are some big negatives to Hong Kong Disney.POSITIVESWait Times   If you go during the week and get there when the park opens (generally at 10:30 AM), you will have 10 minute waits or less for the first couple of hours in the park. We went on a Monday in October and waited 5 10 minutes for all the major rides until around 1:30 2:00 when the park started to get more crowded. Even then, our longest wait was 30 minutes which would be considered short wait times by Orlando standards.Unique Rides   Big Grizzley Mountain is a superb ride that combines the best of Expedition Everest and Big Thunder Mountain. There are two great surprises on this ride that make it stand out as one of the best coasters Disney has assembled. HyperSpace Mountain combines a Star Wars theme to its classic ride to make it more exciting the original. And the new Iron Man ride is outstanding as well. Lastly, Mystic Manor takes the trackless innovation of Tokyo Disney's Winnie the Pooh and creates a Haunted Mansion experience that's truly one of the best.Shows   There are some terrific shows at the park, namely: Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book. Great music, costuming and special effects.NEGATIVESSize   Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely small which means you can pretty much do all the attractions in a single day. We choose to ride our favorite rides 2 3 times and we still rode 80% of the rides at the park.Cast Members   I can't even believe I'm saying this about a Disney property, but the Cast Members were lacking...by a lot! Rarely did we receive a smile. No Disney cheerfulness. No excitement whatsoever in any cast member we saw. It makes you realize how much of the Disney experience is wrapped up in the attitude of their cast members because it soured our taste of this park.Line Cutting   People must have cut in line on us a dozen times or more. It seemed accepted and even the cast members looked the other way (figuratively   because most were looking right at them and didn't do a thing). Again, this really took away from the experience. Nothing about the atmosphere at HK Disney seemed  Disney esque There are other minor items on both sides, but these are the major points of interest. Having been to 9 Disney parks around the world, this would definitely be at the bottom of the list.That being said, if you want to go and ride some terrific rides at a park that is not terribly crowded most of the time, then I would encourage you to go. Quite honestly, the little kids probably won't even notice. But the adults, they will notice that this park does not have the Disney mystique.\n",

      "Our whole family went to this place at the end of June 2014. Primary goal of our vacation to Hong Kong is playing in this park. We went by MTR from Jordan Kowloon heading to disneyland. Disney themed MTR is very interesting and full of families with young children. We had not buy a ticket online so had to queue up first. The queue was not too long, only 10 people, but spend 20 minutes to wait. We had a great time playing and watching a variety of shows here. There is one game that needs special attention is Space Mountain. It was not made clear that this is a Roller Coaster, and since the location is inside a building it looks like a normal train game, so many are not vigilant. If you are indeed ready, healthy and strong please try. In the queuing time, there is a special entrance for those who are not able to continue. There were souvenir shops everywhere. Sell       goods at a price that needs serious consideration, the price is relatively expensive. There are restaurants everywhere, providing Disneyland themed menu. Performances of Disney Characters Parade starts around 14:30. Should come to the Main Street location a bit early in order to get a good position. The game ended in a fireworks show with background Casle Sleeping Beauty (if not mistaken). After completion of the entire event at Disneyland, no need to rush, many vehicles available, especially the Disney MTR available each less than 5 minutes. Enjoyable experience but not going here twice...\n",

      "Went here with family. Took a long travel from Tsim Sha Tsui area. Around 40 minutes. Got there, if you already bought tickets online, just proceed to guest relation counter. Inside the park, if you go together with young kids, you have to pick the ride that suitable for them. Some rides will make them scary. Like the Grizzly Gulch or the Space Mountain.The food and drink were very expensive in there. One small bottle of mineral water will cost you 50 HKD. Actually you can bring your own drink from outside the park ,just make sure you don't bring too many bottle inside your bag.The parade will start at around 3.30pm in the main street if it is not rain on that time.Overall, this theme park suitable for more young kids and since is's small, you can actually finished all the rides in 6   7 hours, depends on the crowds.\n",

      "To fully appreciate and enjoy disneyland, i suggest you to allocate an entire day for this place. Come as early as 9am and stay until the firework display finishes. Disneyland offers numerous attractions and rides where long queues are inevitable. So to save yourself from stress, it would be better to take your time and to take it easy. You will thank yourself for being patient at the end of the day. To be honest, the whole experience for me was a bit underwhelming because I couldn't help myself but compare my experience at Ocean Park the day before. I love animals and extreme rides that disneyland doesn't offer. Also, disneyland doesn't have views like where the seas meet the mountains that ocean park has. Meanwhile, there were things I enjoyed at disneyland that are unique from ocean park. In November 2015, disneyland's musical production was Lion King at that time. I loved every bit of it. I love musicals and all the songs of this musical. It was the closest experience I had to a Broadway production. On the other hand, there was a ride called Space Mountain that I thought was unforgettable. Me and my brothers even did it again twice as it was just so fun. It wasn't as big as the roller coaster at ocean park but it offered a different experience for us. It was a mini roller coaster inside a building that looked like a futuristic mountain from the outside. It felt like we were in the galaxy where it was dark but we could see bright lights like they were stars. As it was dark, every unexpected turn or curve was exhilirating and the galactic music synced with the coaster's speed just sealed the deal for me. It was my favorite ride at Disneyland. Even before coming to disneyland, I always knew that there would be a float parade. It was one of the much awaited attractions for me. We even left the queues just to witness the parade. It was like a celebration. The float parade brought out the kid in me. Most if not all classic disney characters were brought to life that left me smiling the whole time. Lastly, before we left disneyland, we also witnessed the fireworks display. It wasn't the best I've seen but the audio visual presentation in the foreground made all the difference.As a conclusion, if you love musicals, parades, and disney mascots, and you are fine with less intense but creative rides, then Disneyland might just be the perfect theme park for you!\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "We brought tickets before we left and got 2 days for less than the price of 1. After visiting would advise everyone to look for an online deal not worth the walk up price. Castle was closed due to that area being refurbished and altered, weekday aprox no more than a 30 min wait for rides with most being less than that would not recommend weekends or holidays. As has been said like all Disney parks and theme parks in general food and drink is expensive .This is a small park and can easily be done in 1 day\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "FIrstly, this place is small comparing with other theme parks around the world... there was no magical moments as we saw long lines everywhere due to public holidays in China. But again, whether it is weekend pubic holidays or not, there will be long waiting lines due to the demand from mainland China. Fast Pass access was limited to 3 rides which I find it quite ridiculous.Food and drinks were everywhere however as expected the prices were astronomical! Good tip, bring your own bottle water and you can refill at the the drinking stations near the toilets. They charge HKD20 for a small bottle of mineral water! There were many souvenir shops and these are tourist traps and they keep reminding you to buy stuffs are over priced.Overall, a very average experience and would not go back again.\n",

      "July 6   Group of 19 spent a day in Disneyland. What a day, so hot although it rain in between. Everywhere a lot of people, too crowded. You gotta wait for at least 30 minutes for every ride. Wasted a lot of time just waiting.Really enjoyed the fireworks though.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "Apparently, its the smallest Disneyland there is, but hey   when you are less than a meter tall and all your favourite cartoons are walking around you, who cares?!We got to see a few princesses (whose identity were lost on me but not on my little friends). They got hungry quickly so it was kinda good and cool that the maps actually listed out every single thing that was available in the park and which corner. (ie. you can get cotton candy candy floss at the left corner of Fantasyland and if you prefer waffles instead, there is a specific streetcart you can get it at such and such a place). This is important because when kids see something and they want it. They want IT and nothing else. So I'm glad it was easy to 'hunt' for the cotton candy.Because it was small I suppose it was less crowded than the one in Florida   I'm not sure, but it meant we got to sit right by the parade and dance with a few mascot characters. This drove my 5 and 2 year old friends completely out of their mind; it was like y'know, the coolest thing ever. At that age....The show in Adventureland scared them out a bit because all the other rides attractions were held outdoors and had bright colourful lights so going straight into a dimly lit auditorium with a huge lion perching and staring at you from the top was pretty scary. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, you have to wait from 30 45 minutes in line for the rides which is a long time if you have kids. Maybe it would be better if one parent stood in line while the kids went somewhere else to run off the sugar instead...\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "This is a very small disneyland with limited rides. Nothing very thrilling that would excite teenagers or adults. If you have young kids, they would still love most of the rides like  Buzz Astro  and  It's a small world .Interesting thing   there were many middle aged adults (without kids) from China who would be willing to queue for 30  45 minutes to ride the children rides like the flying dumbo elephant. Then when they got onto the rides, they would look so bored. Guess there's really not much else to do.It is still after all a Disneyland and just being there gives you a sense of happiness. So if you've never been to any disneyland in other parts of the world, do get a one day pass to experience the magic.\n",

      "We went to Hong Kong Disneyland during a long holiday in China so the place was packed with people from the mainland on a Monday. We went early, around 10 AM but there were people who came earlier. The Chinese came prepared as they brought with them their umbrellas, foreigners like us walked under the scorching heat. The place was nice, clean and festive. The rides were good and safe. I enjoyed riding the more thrilling rides like the RC and the Space Mountain. Since there were a lot of people that day, we had to wait 20 to 45 minutes to get into a ride. Long queues everywhere.There were a lot of shops for souvenirs but it seems there were not a lot of restaurants. Or maybe there were way to many people for establishments to accommodate. Plus it rained hard and everyone had to run for shelter and most went to the restaurants for shelter and at the same time for lunch.My personal experience wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. I'd give this place a 3.5 if this rating were available. I'd probably go back there but I'd check the dates to avoid any holidays in Hong Kong and the rest of China.\n",

      "Have been to Disney World, Disneyland Anaheim and Tokyo Disneyland but I feel that Disneyland Hong Kong is really too small to be called a Disneyland. It has way too few rides and attractions. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneyland as well. Basically, this park is good only for small children and people who has never been to Disney. The food choices were acceptable, mostly fast food, and not too expensive. Bottled water, however, was VERY expensive but they do have water fountains around for you to refill your water bottles. The parade was pretty good. It was crowded not a problem but what was the problem was the people were just so rude, the pushing and shoving cutting in lines for the rides, gift shops, food stands was just to much to take. forget trying to see one of the shows its a free for all for seats, i don't see how Disney can let this happen, it was by far the worst managed Disney property.\n",

Was there in 2005 6 not long after they open, and the park was awful then, but seems to have improve slowly over time.We are a family of Disney affectionados. Have been to Disney World, Disneyland Anaheim and Tokyo Disneyland more than fifty times combined. We feel that HK Disneyland is really too small to be called a Disneyland. It has way too few rides and attractions. We came to HK Disneyland to see the new Small World attraction. It was perhaps the best small world of all the disney parks, with numerous disney characters like mulan, simba, peter pan, aladdin and more, all in the same style as the other dolls. The entire area right next to Golden Mickeys was also very well done. However, we were VERY disappointed with the Stich Encounter attraction. This attraction is so small and the wait is so long (over 45 minutes), it is not worth it. Actually we thought the show area was just a pre show area, it was tiny and very poorly done. It is very obvious this attraction was hashed together last minute to address the shortfall of attractions in this park.I seriously hope that HK Disneyland could include more signature disney attractions available in all other parks, namely Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain and Toontown. Every year, the park failed to meet attendance expectation and it says a lot about the quality of this park.Basically, this park is good only for small children and people who has never been to Disney.

Several rides in the park are closed for refurbishment   Indiana Jones, haunted mansion, and a large part of fantasyland. These are my two favorite rides!!!!! City hall is also under reconstruction which means giant tarps over the facade. They moved the bakery with the heavenly cinnamon rolls   it just isn't the same. The heat made everyone cranky and short tempered   including cast members. I would feel bad for anyone visiting for the first time   not the magical Disneyland experience we've come to expect.

It was so, so amazingly crowded, thousands of strollers and almost impossible to actually take any rides, although I did use the Fastpass for Indiana Jones & the Haunted Mansion with the cool holiday overlay... I first came here in 1979, then again through the end of the 80's and the early 90's, and there was a time when Disneyland had off peak times, when ride lines were sometimes short. I suppose those times are over. Nothing wrong with that of course. In terms of the Disney magic, I didn't sense much in the faces of cast members who looked hot, bothered, and quite obviously frazzled by dealing with the massive crowds. One cast member on the Disneyland Railway was quite rude to a whole bunch of people with small children waiting for a train. I've never quite seen anything like it before. But there you are...

During our stay, we experienced daily breakdowns of Splash Mountain, Indiana Jones, The Haunted Mansion, and had to be evacuated from the Winnie the Pooh ride. Also Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was closed due to renovations, leaving one less major ride available. Getting in and out of the park is a hassle. In the morning you need the parkhopper card and your room key card. Park hopping requires a handstamp and your parkhopper card for reentry. Oh and they also randomly take your picture to ensure your parkhopper card is really yours. It was cumbersome and very labor intensive for staff and guests. (Disney, there is this thing called technology). We had 4 day parkhoppers, but that is misleading, because you get kicked out of DL on Friday nights unless you purchase an additional armband for $67. Friday evening was the first of Disney's month long two day a week Halloween celebration. The Halloween party requires special admission and sends hoards of people who don't pay for the armband, over to California Adventure. CA is open until midnight, but it was so ridiculously crowded it was impossible to move or go eat. Then CA closes rides on one whole side of the park in order to prepare for World of Color and the lines then become beyond insane. You literally could not move, so we left.About DL Fantasmic and fireworks. On Saturday we waited forever for the fireworks to start. The recording kept playing saying it would begin. After another 20 minutes they cancelled. We felt so bad for the families with little children who waited. BAD FORM DISNEY. Getting a place to watch Fantasmic is difficult. DL staff seem more interested in telling people where not to go, or keeping people moving than they do in assisting people. The way DisneyWorld handles Fantasmic is much more efficient. Just skip it and ride rides. They say that September is a good time to visit and the crowds are down   not true. Now all that said, we did have fun. The park is very clean and well manicured. The little side shows are so cute and enjoyable. When the rides were working they were a blast. We really enjoyed CA as it seemed less hectic and crowded than DL. Was our stay and park experience worth the price?   NOOverall, if you have a choice between DL and DW, pick DW. DW is a better bang for the buck.I don't see us visiting DL again. We can't imagine how terrible it would be to go during the peak season....WOW that would be a waste of $\n",

      "Been going to Disneyland since I was a little kid. Every year the ticket prices go up and the lines get longer. This time we were so shocked at how many rides kept going out of service all weekend. We paid over $700.00 for tickets for two adults and two kids for 2 days. After paying for parking and food and a few shirts I'm sure it cost me at least 1000.00 bucks. So many people were in the park it was hard to even walk around. Long lines for food, rides and bathrooms. Fast passes ran out quick and were not available. We spent so much time walking around trying to get on rides that were either out of service when we got there or went out of service while we were in line. Indiana jones, haunted mansion, Astro boasters, space mountain, cars, scream and big thunder railroad are just some of the rides that had technical problems and were closed off and on. Just not fun to stand in line for 40 min to have them announce  Sorry we are having technical problems and the ride is temporarily closed . No other information is given. Could be closed 5 min or 5 hours. I have never experienced this in all the years of going to Disneyland. I remember thinking as we were waiting for over 2 hours in line for the cars ride how we must all be brain washed to pay 700.00 to stand in lines all day and think it's somehow fun. Don't think we will return until they limit the number of people that are let in the park each day. Just not worth the price they are charging anymore. \n",

      "I think I was way to exitced to come to Disneyland. I held my expectations way to high. This was my very first visit to Disneyland, and I was super exitced! I had been to the Disney World resort in Florida and totally loved it! However, Disneyland wasn't the same. I was honestly not happy with my visit. There were a lot of rides closed the day I visited, (mid March 2017). This caused a lot of the other rides to be very busy. I didn't even ride 10 rides. I only recall riding Splash Mountain, Haunted Mansion, It's a Small World, Big Mountain Thunder Railroad, The Finding Nemo Ride, Dumbo, and Space Mountain. We also rode a couple of slow rides in the back near the castle. I really would suggest getting a fast pass to Space Mountain. My cousin and I waited in the line for an hour and four minutes. Once we were finished with the ride the wait was nearly three hours. The wait would have been better if we were not waiting in the hot sun. I would also say the the Haunted Mansion ride isn't very good. They say it's a roller coaster but in reality it's not. It has one small drop but compared to Big Mountain Thunder Railroad it was nothing. Speaking of Big Mountain Thunder Railroad that ride was shut down for more than half of the day. It didn't re open until close to 8 o'clock. As for the other rides, I really liked Splash Mountain. It was a nice little ride and we didn't get very wet. I would suggest getting a fast pass for this one, espically if you are planning to go on it in the late afternoon. My Mom and I did the finding Nemo ride and it was pretty cool. You go underwater in a sub marine and it's quite the lengthy ride so it passes time if your waiting for something else. The food overall was very good! We all got salads for lunch and it was probally the best salad I had ever eaten. It was fresh and was nice and cold too. It also came with a good sauce as well. However, I was disapointed with Dinseyland due to so many rides being closed and shut down. I wanted to go on the Pirates of the Caribban ride since I had never been on it before, but it was closed. \n",

      "Big Disney fan my whole life. I've been on multiple trips to Disneyland, Disney World, and Disneyland in Paris throughout my life. I loved them all. Our last trip to Disneyland (September 2018) was a complete nightmare. We picked one of the lowest seasons of the year, knowing that some rides and attractions would be closed. It was worth it for us because we thought we would be avoiding big crowds.Instead, we found many many rides closed, AND the biggest crowds we have ever seen there. Incredibly hard to walk around and get anywhere. Long lines at all the rides. Families stressed out and rushing all over the park. Horrible, horrible atmosphere.The magic is completely GONE. You can't even appreciate the beauty of the park because people are in the way. People are EVERYWHERE.If anyone remembers the magic and the music and simply strolling around and enjoying everything in sight (during low season), that is gone forever.All we found were stressed out moms, sweating and pulling their kids all over the park, racing to get to rides before everyone else did. If you don't rush, you're doomed.Remember when you would run into characters and actually be able to spend some time with them? That does not happen anymore. If you want to spend 3 seconds with Minnie, stand in line for at least 20min. If you're lucky, you'll get to her. Normally you won't, and have to wait some more for the next character. If you want to say hi to Captain America or Spiderman or Black Panther, be prepared to wait in line for 40min or longer.This is LOW SEASON, people. I can't even imagine the park being fuller than it was. It seemed impossible to us that more people could fit. But when we went, crowd levels were at 2 10!!!!Cast members are no longer kind and warm. They are all completely stressed out and rude and even mean. No wonder. Their job of keeping things together is very hard.Horrible, horrible and very disappointing experience for my whole family. I had spent years telling my kids all about the magic of Disneyland, and none of it is left.If Disney doesn't limit crowds somehow, I don't think we'll ever be going back. The park is beautiful. The rides are great. The crowds are the problem. They create the stressful competitive rude atmosphere that makes everything feel like a big fat race.\n",

      "Extremely long wait times and short ride duration. Posted wait time 150 min and ended up waiting for 2 and 1 2 hours at Cars ride. Fast passes out by 10 am. Some staff helpful but normally looking like they would rather be somewhere else. Food costs high and again staff    unenthusiastic    at providing assistance. We   ve been to Disney Florida, Universal Florida and California and have never encountered wait times like this. There is no entertainment, no updates on wait times or staff available when waiting in these lines, just the same tracks of music playing over and over. Very disappointing way to spend the day and lots of money.\n",

      "I have visited DisneyWorld in Florida many times and in my opinion; Disneyland does not compare. Disneyland is much smaller with long lines to mostly all of the attractions. We visited mid week before the spring break crowds in March. The attractions are not as nice in most cases as those in DisneyWorld but if you have never been to DisneyWorld you will probably love your visit to Disneyland if you can go during a time when it is less crowded.\n",

      "We have visited Disney World in Florida many times. We knew this park was smaller but excited to visit a new park. We were disappointed for their 60 anniversary. Yea it rained but did not except it to shut down all the rides, cancel the parade and fireworks. The Florida park handles rain just fine but this park does not. You would have thought a tornado landed in the middle of Torrowland. The park is significantly smaller than Disney World but knowing that Walt walked the streets were pretty cool. I excepted high prices but they were similar to those at Disney World. Glad I say that we went but won't be wanting to plan another trip.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "Having visited disneyworld Florida many times we were expecting a great couple of days, we were to be very disappointed. We were redirected to a car park at the outer edge of downtown disney and basically left to find our own way to the park which was a extremely long walk. The fact that disney knew we were being redirected as they were waiting ready to take the $16 parking fee they should have laid transport on to the park. The park was chaos, we put a fast pass in and it came up for 6 hours later so stopped us from using it again. I asked a assistant in one of the shops about a item and she said she would find out and then just left me. Splash Mountain was shut all day. Basically they just let to many people into the park on both days we went. It's expensive and we expected better\n",

      "We visited the park for the very first time. This was our first trip to California and felt Disneyland was an absolute must. We have visited Disney world in Florida several times and my review compares to trips there. I would not return to this park in the future. I felt as though the park was way understaffed for this high week in tourism. The lines were tremendously long as you would anticipate but very few staff controlling crowd movement thru the park. It didn   t feel as though it was a well run Disney machine like we have experienced in the past. Along with the mob feeling we had we noticed this park is not kept as clean as Florida. Again I would attribute this to the lack of proper staffing. It felt like the higher ups just said stuff as many people in here as we can and we will just blame it on vacation week. I would honestly spend the money on something else while in California. \n",

      "Perhaps visiting on a halloween special day affected this but after visiting Disneyworld in Florida a few times I was excited to try the California park. I was disappointed. Everything was cramped, the way the queues were set up was bizarre, with Matterhorn in particular just sending us round in circles trying to find the end of the queue! A lot of the big rides weren't even working.The staff seemed bored and uninterested, whereas at Disneyworld they are very much actors in character and not staff   that difference was very obvious.We visited Califonria Adventure next door too which was much better   save your money and just visit there instead.\n",

      "Having visited Disneyworld in Florida several times we thought we would try Disneyland whilst in California.We found the whole experience rather underwhelming ,rides closed ,rides breaking down whilst on them, and some long waits even for fast pass.The electric parade and late night fireworks were very good, but we think that the admission prices are far to high for this theme park.,Walt Disney world not be impressed ! This might be the original Disney but it falls way short of the Disneyworld Florida.\n",

      "We have read that coming to Disney on Christmas would be a great experience for our family. Well, it was a great disappointment. Let's begin with it costs over $400.00 to get into Disney for a family of four, so for that price your expectations are allowed to be high. It was crowded, beyond belief, but hey its Christmas so that was expected. Our first stop was Space Mountain to get a Fast Pass time, ride broken. Our second stop was the Matterhorn, ride broken. Our third stop was Indiana Jones, ride broken. Our fourth stop was the Haunted House, ride broken. Need I say more? This is how our entire day went, no Fast Passes and almost all rides broken all day. Needless to say, we will not return. We recommend Universal, Knotts or something else, until Disney fires its ride engineers and learns how not to ruin Christmas for over 60,000 people. Bottom Line   Disney has some serious issues and the  Murphy's Law  excuse we got all day just does not cut it. \n",

      "Decided to surprise the kids, 2 and 4 year old, and go to Disneyland for Christmas.Wait time for average rides was 40 minutes, average wait time for popular rides was 90  minutes. You could barely move in the park. Wife and I were extremely frustrated and disappointed. On the pro side, they do make an effort to provide healthy food. Plenty of options for fresh fruits and vegetables at the park, which was a very nice surprise.Bottom line, if you are the type person that likes the Disney experience try to go during the low season, otherwise your enjoyment will be diluted.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "A two day pass with lunches for a family of four set us back over $800.00. Wait times for the more popular rides was about 45 minutes. Way too crowded and over priced to warrant a return trip.\n",

      "We went on a Saturday in October, the only day we had free to go. It was so packed we could hardly move, wait times for the popular rides were two hours long, FastPass distribution closed early, we went back to Splash Mountain in our return window to use the one FastPass we did get only to find the ride was closed due to mechanical issues (we did finally get on later), traffic was herded one way after shows meaning even if you hadn't watched a show you had to go that one way which was usually the opposite direction you were trying to go to get to a ride, AND, we didn't see any characters walking around   we even dedicated time to go to Toontown only to find there were 75 minute waits to meet Mickey and Minnie. My 12 year old niece left Disneyland disappointed with an empty autograph book she had bought with her own money. Overall the experience was not enjoyable and was a letdown. We had traveled all the way from Canada with an unfavorable exchange rate just to be stuck in crowds and herded like cattle. Disneyland lets way too many people in, to the point guests hardly get to see and do what they were excited for. Walt would be aghast, haha!We did finally get on some of the rides we wanted to late at night, and they were fun and slightly redeemed the park's image. That is the only reason I'm giving Disneyland a three instead of a two.\n",

      "I was in Disneyland for a work conference and went to the park around five. I thought being there in the evening and at night would mean less crowds, but boy was I wrong. The wait times for popular rides were 2 hours! I am guessing in March there were some spring break crowds. I do not recommend going on a weekend in March! It was elbow to elbow crowds. I think too much is packed into a small park. I much prefer Disneyworld where you have some breathing room.\n",

      "Attended Disneyland in January with Family of 5. Not   newbies   to Disneyland,last time had a 10 day pass for family so a little bit familiar with whole Disney theme..... we were in early group entering so would have thought Disney Staff would have been Fresh and Happily greeting   Guests  ..... The lady at the gate we entered was more sour than a lemon ! No Good Morning, No welcome to Disneyland ......in fact don't think she spoke at all, she just gestured with her hand what she wanted. After Entering and walked around a bit notice more cast members had similar blank, uninterested faces.With teenagers now, and found 1 day at Disneyland and 1 day at Disney California was more than enough. Just did the main rides and that was that. Could not be bothered with the wait times at the popular rides ie, Hyper Space Mountain..... then it wasn't working anyway later in the day. Did Star Tours once only up to an hour wait....... even Peter Pan was over 40 minutes ??? very surprised at the time of year so many people on a Tuesday?And the Price of Food inside is insanely expensive....when you consider the price of the Park Tickets as well ....really think we've done our dash with Disney.\n",

      "I know that the week between Christmas and New Year's is a very busy time for Disneyland and all the theme parks in southern California, so I expected long lines and thick crowds. It was much worse than I imagined! The crowds were so large that maneuvering around several areas required us to shuffle our feet slowly, watching for stroller wheels next to us, elbow to elbow with the other guests   literally. The wait times for the popular rides ranged from 90 minutes to 180 minutes. Yes, the staff was exceptional, as always, but it would have been an enjoyable visit if HALF as many guests had been admitted. Walt has been gone for many years and it appears to me that the current management errs on the side of greed rather than maintaining a good quality experience. I have lived my entire life within a couple hours drive of Disneyland in Anaheim   I have good memories of the place. After this miserable experience, I do not plan to ever visit again, unless they change their policies and practices. Oh, incidentally, we spent a total of $234 parking, getting in and eating   for just 2 people.\n",

Food court prices ridiculous, would think with the high cost of admission, you wouldn't need to make a fortune on food also. Restrooms dirty, but the grounds were fairly clean considering the mass amount of people who can't clean up after themselves...Doubt the kids will want to return, they didn't even talk about it much, so sad..\n",

      "Fast pass appears to be a tool to minimize your wait time for some popular rides. It isn't.You can on ly have one fast pass outstanding at a time, and you uusally have to wait 40 minutes or so to be able to use it. So you really cannot use it to increase the number of rides you can enjoy.The only thing fast pass accomplishes is that it allows you to avoid standing in the line and to instead, waner in the park while you're waiting. This is a huge benefit    for Disnay. People do not spend money while standing in line for an hour. But those who wander in the park with nothing to do for an hour will almost invariably spend money, at the very least for high priced snacks.this isn't to say you shouldn't use fast pass. Just do so with your eyes open and recognizing what it's really about: a tool to switch your wait time to a situation likely to induce you to spend more.\n",

      "I visited the Disneyland park one day because I had a quick weekend in Anaheim and had nothing to do. First of all I purchased a one day park hopper ticket from my hotel for $155. I find it extremely expensive to go to both Disneyland and California Adventure. I can go to other theme parks in the Los Angeles area for about $60 a day. I walked into the park and it was packed. I wasn't really surprised because it was a weekend and it was Disneyland. I wanted to get in line for Star Tours. It was an hour wait so I decided to get a fast pass. I tried getting on Space Mountain which was another hour wait. So I tried to get a fast pass and it wouldn't let me get one because I had the one for Star Tours. I remembered when I went in 2012 I could get an unlimited number of fast passes but now I can't. I finally got on the Haunted mansion after an HOUR in the park. I wouldn't have a problem in waiting in these lines if they would put more shade up. It happened to be one of the hottest days in Anaheim and I got hot quick. After that I got in this huge line for the Star Tours Fast Passes. Now I thought we were allowed to go in immediately once our time was called, that did not happen. They let small groups of 4 people go in at a time. Of course the line is in the heat and I started to get furious. I decided to get lunch and bought Gumbo and a drink for $15. I went to California Adventure afterward to go ride some rides. I go in line for Screaming over California. Since I was by myself I could ride single rider. I walk to the guy and he told me I had to wait in the regular line. I wanted to cuss him out. I never had this problem before. So I decided to go back to my hotel and wait until later to come back when everyone else has left. It isn't the same anymore. They just want to over charge on anything. I do not have plans on returning to the park.\n",

      "Went to Disneyland on 31st December, 2013. After going to Disney World in Orlando two years earlier, we were excited to experience the Disney magic all over again.We knew it would be busy as it was New Year's Eve but we were told when we arrived that if the park reached capacity, no more tickets would be sold. This was to ensure an enjoyable and comfortable experience for all. I don't know what the park's capacity is, but I have never experienced such a crowded place in my life. It was intense. ProsFireworks were goodIt was easy to get to the park from the car park   via shuttle or a short walk. ConsLines for rides were up to 200 minutes. Long lines for the bathroom.Restaurants required bookings (but this was not advertised)Lines for 'take away' style food were very long, limited places to sit and eat this food. Our 'fast pass' to one ride was available to us between 12 1am. We got the ticket issued at 4pm.Hard to move around the park due to crowding but also due to ropes cutting off access points between areas. We felt like cattle getting moved around, aimlessly going nowhere. The iconic castle was very much the 'poor cousin' to the Disney world version.We left at 1am, hoping to miss the 12am rush after the fireworks, it took over 1 hour to get out of the car park   no Disney staff to direct the traffic. I appreciate that New Year's is a busy time, but our Disney world experience two years earlier was the week of Christmas and it was excellent. If you have a choice between Disney world and Disneyland. It's Orlando Disney all the way!\n",

Toilets were not very clean in the parks and smelly. Not a magical experience, Florida is far superior. Would not visit here again, there is no atmosphere.

Poor queuing system for rides (they need to adopt Legolands Q bot system), shocking toilets, rude people Q jumping and smoking in front of children. NO characters anywhere and overpriced junk food. Everywhere you look it's just shops, shops and more shops. We paid a lot of money for three days and I just wish I had put it towards a trip to Florida which sounds like the real deal.

With so many being shut resulted in horrendous lines for everything else even if one had Fast Pass. Even though it's a Disney it's a world away from the American ones where the atmosphere and staff are wonderful, here they are rude, inattentive and have a couldn't care less attitude.Would we visit here again?......no way.\n",

      "This is was our fourth visit to Disneyland Paris, we went with our 7 year old daughter and 5 and 4 year old sons. It was also our 1st visit since we travelled to Disney florida 2 years ago. Perhaps it's unfair to compare the two directly and I will start with the positives.It's a lot closerIt's convenient for a short break from the ukThe brand new toy story area in the studio park is goodEr that's about it.My main issue is that the management team at Disney Paris have decided to both cut costs and maintain or increase prices, you don't have to be a genius (and I'm not) to work out that this will directly affect the quality of service and the experience on offer.Their main problem is staffing, in previous years the staff have been generally pretty good, now their numbers appear to have been cut and their morale is poor, many of them have decided to express their dissatisfaction by being rude and or unhelpful. Several times I was pushed past by Disney staff without a word, or ignored when asking for help, I couldn't help but compare this to Florida where the staff were uniformly excellent.Small problems became obvious when you looked, the public toilets were almost all filthy, the general areas were kept tidy but the flower beds were full of weeds, all of these imperfections are unthinkable in Florida. Perhaps it was bad luck but many of the rides were continuously going out of service. And many of the attractions are now 20 years old and look worn. It's all a real shame as I've always previously enjoyed Disney Paris and I now feel that this will be my last visit until I hear some continuous positive feedback on this site about how things have improved.To finish on a positive note we stayed at the Davy Crockett ranch and it was absolutely fine. If you do get a premium plus cabin like we did, please note that they only have Ethernet connections and no wireless Internet so you can't connect unless you have a Ethernet equipped device. And there is no wireless anywhere in the parks that I could find so sort your 3G data allowance before you go.\n",

      "Every child must go to Disney. Unfortunately, I never did, but I wanted my child to experience the magic of Disney. She is five and a bit and is crazy about Frozen, Tinker Bell, Belle   the usual stuff. So, three of us went. We stayed at the Davy Crockett Ranch, one of Disney hotels. This will be a separate review. Loved it (Davy Crockett), by the way.Disney positives: The fireworks show, which starts at 10:30pm, is bloody awesome. The daily parade of Disney characters (around 5:30pm) is worth seeing at least once. Your child will love it.The train journey around the park is a sneaky way to rest your feet   you can ride on and on, it goes around in circles and you don't have to get off.That's all, folks! Now the negatives and why we are not coming back:Smoking. I have nothing against people who smoke. I can have a cheeky one myself. Now and again. But never ever in front of a child or where a child might see me. In Disneyland you can smoke anywhere. Literally   anywhere! This is a children's theme park, last I checked, and your child can get a whiff of second hand smoke even in a queue of Crush Coaster Nemo ride. Lots of people smoking   in front of their children, in front of my child... This is just wrong. Hated it.Queues   we all know that one has to queue at Disney, but as it turns out the wait at most (no, scrap that   ALL) rides is at least an hour, usually just under two hours. And then the ride lasts 3 5 minutes. Disney might say  oh, but it's because the rides are so popular! . I say    it's because of rubbish organisation and planning. . As much as my child is dedicated to Disney, it's a torture to have her wait five hours to go on three rides.Food. It's very overpriced and very inedible. You'll find that everywhere, in all different restaurants, they have the same menu, same prices and same quality. My waiter was very apologetic, he knew exactly what I meant when I said this was the worst food we ever put in our mouths in France. Of course, there's an option of packing your own lunch, but we just don't like to carry more than we absolutely have to. Imagine 30 degrees heat, you are fighting your way through a crowd, with a tired child, with a backpack stuffed of half melted sandwiches on your back...There are no Disney characters out in the park for kids to cuddle up to and have a photo taken with. You know how they show Disney Florida TV adverts and there's always a kid hugging a Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse? I expected those to just roam the streets of Disney Town. None of that. Not a single Mickey to be hugged or photographed. Maybe it's just not a French thing...So, that's it, really. As great as the fireworks show and the parade were, it is way outweighed by excessively long queues, smoking all around, and overpriced and bad food everywhere. No Disney magic for us. Disappointed, we are not going back. Not to Disney France anyway.\n",

      "Went during Easter break and we expected the place to be busy   but to queue for 1.5 hours with a 7 & 3 year old was not my idea of fun. We stayed in the Davy Crockett Ranch so drove in each day and the car park was never more than half full by the time we left so I dread to think what it must be like in high season. The magic hour entry is a waste of time since Frontierland still doesn't open till 10am. The rides are pretty average and the prices for other things now astronomic with the exchange rate. The charaacters are good fun, if you want to stand for an hour to get a 'fake' in costume to sign a book. Benn there, got the T shirt; won't bother again!\n",

      "You have to approach Disney with the knowledge that it is over priced and crowded. This was our third time. (We are a family of 3 adults on a nostalgia trip!). The first time was just after it opened. We stayed at the Davy Crockett Ranch and there were a lot of teething troubles. It was cold and wet and our daughter was ill. The second time was better   we were in the Newport Bay Hotel and the Walt Disney studios had just opened. This was in the summer and very hot and crowded. This time we stayed in the Hotel New York (see my separate review for this), which was a better location, although not observably of a higher standard. The worst thing was the food in the park   very expensive fast food, mostly burgers and doughnuts. We had a nice meal in Planet Hollywood, but again expensive. The best thing was the truly spectacular evening laser show  we saw it from a slight angle as we wanted to sit down on a bench and are too old to sit on the floor. This was not the school holidays so the visitors were mostly families with under 5s, we were dodging push chairs and lots of Disney princesses underfoot. Many parents were smoking. We did not have to queue for any rides   under 10m max, mostly we walked straight on. (We avoided the thrill rides).Our favourites were the Riverboat, Le pays des compte de fees, Cinemagique and the Studio tram. Old favourites like Phantom manor, Pirates, Star tours did not impress this time round. Quite a few popular rides were closed, and not all  restaurants  were open every day. The parade was very good and the evening laser show spectacular. We were lucky with the weather   2 days were hot and the rest was showers, some heavy, but still quite warm. However Disney fails completely when it rains heavily   the barn like restaurants fill up and there is inadequate seating under cover to sit it out. We had four nights and 5 days but you only really need 3 days to see what you want to see, so we took a car to La vallee village, which is like Biscester shopping village. Designer stuff is not our thing but it was great to get away from the magic kingdom for a couple of hours. Next to it is Val d'europe which is a very nice shopping mall. We ate our best meal of the whole trip here, at an Italian restaurant. We have no tips to offer, everyone has their own view on what they want to get out of Disney and luck plays a part in whether you get it or not. I don't think we'll be back.\n",

      "I have never written a review before so I don't really know where to start......... This was our annual holiday this year. We did come over three years ago in February and we had a nice time this week was a completely different story...We stayed at the Davy Crockett Ranch which was actually nice, very dark but clean and local to the park. I guess it went downhill from there.We have a disabled son so knew that we could get a pass in 'City Hall' which would enable us to access the rides easier. After a 35 minute queue a lady took our details and before handing over the pass decided to ask and tick off a range of boxes that applied to our sons needs; 'is he mentally deficient?' She asked. I'm sure there are more sensitive and more appropriate ways to address this. You would think the pass would make our life easier... We were wrong. After fighting the crowds to get to The pirate ride we were told that we needed to book a time slot   we did this for four hours later (the earliest slot they had) and fought our way back through the crowds to Thunder mountain for my eldest daughter   that wasn't working so then to Space Mountain   we collected the fast pass and went to the buzz lightyear ride   we waited 40 minutes at the disabled gate, a Disney Customer Service Rep walked by and asked us if she could help   I explained what we were waiting for and she replied with ' I'm not on this section so I can't help you!' I could go on about the fact that Space Mountain then broke down, the fact that a Disney Rep pushed our wheelchair out the way to make space for another family so we couldn't see the parade, the disgusting toilets, the rude staff and the fact that even when you ask people not to blow spoke in your sons face they then do it again on purpose, the way we were told to make our way to the disabled seats through a crowd of people sitting on the floor in Playhouse Disney without any help, the way we were told to hurry up off the slinky dog ride as we were holding up the queue (not easy with a 7 years old who can't walk), I could go on, but you get the picture.Having been to both Florida and California I find it hard to believe that they are in the same company as euro disney   it needs a whole new fresh management system and someone who is customer service orientated driving it forward.We won't be going back ever again.\n",

      "We visited end of September, this was my third visit. We stayed in hotel New York which was fine (good location, good quality and not as expensive as the Disney Hotel)Most of the rides were open and because it was after season and not during school holidays it was not busy.. no waiting lines does add to the fun ; )However, half the restaurants were closed and the remaining half all had a similar menu.. burgers or chicken with fries.. Doesn't seem difficult to make one would think still at every location it seems there were new kitchen crew trying to figure out how to do it the first time. Every single lunch we had was bad... The wide spread stores are all well kept (much better than the attractions) but they are all selling the same stuff. Unfortunately one can see that Disney is saving on maintenance... all the attractions look worse and worse.. also the staff gets worse... only a few are truly 'cast members' playing their part but most are uninterested and apparently in a bad mood... a far cry from what you get in California or Florida.No wonder they are in financial problems as it is all just too 'french' (bad maintenance, bad service, rude and or uninterested). Also French as main (and sometimes only) language takes away it's European appeal.. It is about time that Disney takes control and puts in place American management.However; one absolutely awesome attraction is the evening laser show at the castle. Magnificent!! As an adult I was blown away and I can only imagine the impression this would make on kids.. Awesome!As a conclusion, Disney Paris is a great attraction park and if you have the money it is still a must visit especially with kids. But it has become a faded shadow of the parks in Florida and California which is sad to see.\n",

      "We travel to Disneyland Paris, on average, once per year and, for us, this will probably be our last for quite a while for a number of reasons; tired d  cor, slow service and rides not running. We stayed at Hotel New York (our fourth stay at this hotel) and the customer service was exceptional. The check in lady was efficient.The same cannot, however, be said for customer service at Magic Kingdom. We all had colds so we were regularly queuing for hot drinks. The shortest queue we stood in took 25 minutes and there were probably only five people in front of us! Whether it was the coffee machine or the speed of the server, this was a really boring (expensive) way to spend our limited time at the park. We wasted most of our 'extra magic hour' (a perk of staying at a Disney hotel) walking around the park to find a ride that was working   there seem to be lots of 'technical issues'. The whole place is beginning to look tired and this is the first time I've come away from Disney feeling disappointed and not eager to plan the next trip. A real shame.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "Stayed in the Hotel New York, as we had previously, and were not disappointed. Rooms kept clean to good standard. Breakfast environment good and did not feel rushed or cramped as in Sequoia Lodge. Inside the Park was where the real disappointment came. Not so many characters available around the park as there used to be. Parades no longer get the children involved. We had blue badge passes for easy access to rides, only to find that some rides now have a booking system   this was not explained at the time of pass issue at City Hall. Ate in several restaurants on th half board tickets, but selection of food in some retsaurants not very appealing and quite pricey. We will be leaving it for a few years before visiting again.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "Just returned from 4 nights staying at Hotel New York, a Disney hotel on site. It was a family holiday with two boys, aged 4 & 6. True, we went in peak season so should have expected it to be busy but WOW was it busy! Day 1 was spent arriving mid afternoon and then queueing a total of 2 hours for 4 minutes of fun on mediocre rides. We were totally unimpressed at that point and we wondering why we had spent all that money on this trip that both the kids and us were hating. But...Day 2 we thought how best to approach things. Staying in the Disney hotel meant we could get in at 8:00 (2 hours before regular guests). We used that effectively to do most of our rides in the day. We then just wandered and relaxed for the main part of the day and rested at the hotel. Returning later in the afternoon until closing was again pleasant although still busy. In the end the kids loved it and there was plenty to do with a mixture of areas to spend time in.The cafe staff were horrendously slow. I kid you not, I waited 45 minutes in a queue of 10 people for 4 bottles of drink and 4 brioche. The coffee machines aren't even high quality, time consuming espresso machines. We are talking push the button and the drink comes out things!Then there is health and safety. OTT. Flying elephant ride as an example. You queue for an hour. You are put into a holding area. You are given a ticket. You get into an elephant. They take your ticket back off you and check your seat belt. Then someone else checks it. It takes ages for no benefit. Another example was the Cars waltzers. A young boy dared to put his hands straight up in the air nowhere near anyone else or in danger to himself. So the staff stopped the ride and told him to behave. Next go, a man got on with a balloon tied to his bag. Instead of taking both into the office for 2 minutes whilst the ride went on, the staff made him remove the balloon from the bag, put the balloon in the office and made him keep his bag. Again, a real hold up for the waiting masses with no real benefit. Highlights:  Ratatouille (fast pass it early in the day as vvvvv busy)  Buzz Lightyear  Stunt show in Studio ParkLowlights:  Queuing   OTT health and safety\n",

      "Half Term as parents with an eight year old, we embarked upon our first trip to Disneyland Paris and overall, felt disappointed despite our child enjoying the experience. Pros: pain free transfer from CDG airport on VEA Navette to the resort; staying at Disney's Hotel New York was close to the parks and provided plenty photo opportunities with Disney characters. Cons: hotel's well publicised ice skating rink was an additional cost despite staying there and anyway, was out of use for the full four days, despite freezing temperatures outside and Disney lakes being frozen over thus halting boat trips. Accommodation requires urgent updating. Food is unhealthy, tasteless and of a poor standard throughout. We chose not to opt for meal deals as part of out package, thinking this would provide the freedom and choice for better food. How wrong were we? Believe it or not, the best place for a fresh salad and water was McDonalds! Shame on you Disney. Also their coffee machines throughout the resort are awful. Best coffee was at the airport. Tips: use FastPass where you can; the Disneyland Paris App is not always updated with queue times etc. or does not offer the option of making a restaurant reservation; buy tickets for Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show; best 'Cast Members' were those at the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.\n",

      "My husband, daughter aged 10 and I have just returned from Disneyland Paris. We stayed at Hotel New York from 12 15th inclusive. Drive down from Calais not bad   this was our fourth visit. Checked in quickly at Hotel but disappointed to find no kettle in room and very surly cleaners on arrival at our room door. A great Disney welcome (not!). Unfortunately it was English half term and French school holidays and the park was very busy. Weather was attrocious and we had nowhere to get wet clothes dry easily. Queues to see the characters were long, we gave up half the time. Food was ridiculously expensive. We went to Planet Hollywood for Valentines Lunch and the in house photographer would not take no for an answer until I exploded. Went for coffee, and deli sandwiches one night cost 20 euros. Gave up after that and went to McDonalds. We found the French were given preferential treatment for everything. Queues everywhere all the time through security, for meals, characters. Having said that the new Buzz ride is great and the Stunt Show remains a favourite.However we will not return. Journey back home took 1 hour longer due to accident just on Paris outskirts. Save your money for Florida   we are going to and we are sure the food will be cheaper and the American people so much more warm and welcoming.\n",

      "I took my two grown up children in September and we stayed at the Hotel New York. The hotel was four star and the staff were really helpful but the food in the Parkside Diner was barely three star and the coffee completely undrinkable. Eight of the attractions were closed for maintenance, including three of the big thrills. The food throughout is very expensive and poor quality. The cost of basics like water is extortionate, so take drinks bottles and fill your own.\n",

      "Spent 3 days here with my wife and 14yo daughter. Stayed at Disney's Hotel New York so we'd get into the park early before the general public. A waste of time as most rides didn't open until 10am. Have been to parks in other parts of the world where crowds are managed so much better than here. Poor crowd control, poor food, poor service. Several major rides closed for renovation however we were not told of these closures when Disney took our booking. I feel cheated. Never again!\n",

Kids being sick in toilets etc. etc. Stayed at the Hotel New York for two nights, used disney express, worked very well, staff were polite in the hotel and room was clean but very tired looking, I.e. Stained shower curtain, smelly bathroom.As for the park, we enjoyed the second day, BUT it really was very busy with half term for the French and English, would rather take children out of school if trip was repeated but it won't be!! Rides broke down on numerous occasions, 120 mins wait for Ratatouille, fast passes worked fine when rides didn't break down. Staff ok on the whole but I can honestly say it's an experience I would not repeat. Not being a mad disney fan myself I thought it would be fun. It was BUT think we would have had more fun in a less plastic environment, my husband told me so, need to start listening a bit more. Not for us sadly. Food was awful too, looking forward to being back at home.\n",

      "The park is beautiful, one has to admit, it is also spotlessly clean but the queues are AWFUL. We visited it in May 2015 for 3 days during the week and I don't know if we came across some school holidays in France but it was fairly busy. We hated the queues: When you are with small kids (or even for us adults), you can't be expected to wait online for (at least) 2 hours for an attraction. It also happened twice that the attraction then shut down all of a sudden because of a technical problem. So then we had to come back the next day. Also the Fast pass doesn't really work. You have to queue for that too and the tickets are only given at certain times of the day, so chances are if you are not quick enough to get the tickets, they will be already finished before you even get to the Fastpass machine.We liked very much the Ratatouille attraction, which is truly great fun, and the stunt show in the Disney Studios. Some other attractions were also nice but everything was tainted by the incredibly long queues. The restaurants are very expensive, you need to reserve the ones with the Disney characters and make sure you respect the time you booked. The quality of the food is not great, so not good value for money. The dinner with the princesses was nice and also the one with Mickey and company but expensive and rushed (at least the one with Mickey). We had booked a package with dinners so I recommend that, if you want to the children to see the characters. There was also a Wild West Show, which was great but had to be payed separately.The park is a great commercial stunt. You can't help buying stuff. We were not lucky with the weather, it was cold and rainy and that's not the best weather condition to visit the park and queue for hours. Of course then you must buy rain coats and all which will impact on your budget. So I recommend you bring rainboots and raincoats if you are planning to visit during a time when it could rain. We stayed at the New York Hotel, that was such a disappointment. The buffet breakfast in the morning is appaling, worse than a fast food and the room are basic and do not look clean. I would certainly not go there again.\n",
      "====================================================================================================\n",
      "We stayed in the New York Hotel, for 4 nights, so that gave us passes to the 2 parks on offer. The passes allowed us to get 2 extra hours before the general public, but we found this was not the case as they were letting everyone in early. The parks themselves are very clean with plenty of toilets and easy to navigate your way around. The main gripe that we had was that the food was expensive and not brilliant, typical theme park burgers and fast food, BUT we did managed to find a salad that was not covered in 1000s of calories dressing on the last day. The shops are well stocked if a little pricey, but it is Disney after all. There are so many rides and attractions to suit all ages so no one should be bored. The high light of day 3 was staying behind after the park shut to watch the firework show around the castle, this went on for about 20 mins and it is Not to be missed, excellent finish to the day.\n",

      "The whole family likes Disneyland and this is a regular visit for us but somehow this time it did not feel quite the same, obscenely expensive (we knew that before going but this time it did not represent value for money), very busy (well it was August) and they have changed the Fast Pass system ( you really have to get the Premium Pass or you have to queue for too long).We stayed in the New York Hotel which looks ugly from the outside and dated on the inside and the whole park has this feeling of being run down and un cared for. I was genuinely horrified to see vegetation growing out of the exhibits on the Studio tour and it gave me a sense of no one really caring about the park and being more worried about the profit margin rather than the user experience. Rides kept breaking down, staff were friendly enough on the park but aggressive and thoughtless in the hotel. If you have young kids then great, If they are over 10 then I cannot recommend it.\n",

      "Having had an absolutely amazing experience in WDW Florida last year, we were so excited to come to Disneyland Paris. However, we've been left quite disappointed for a few reasons which I'll go into a but later.Good points   it's clean.  the two parks are near each other so switching between the two is easy.  shows are in English and French so you can choose which language you see a show in.  staying in the New York hotel gave us fast passes for each day so we didn't have to queue. Using rider swap also helped us make the most of them although we only knew about this from having been to WDW, no one says about it here. We just asked on the off chance.   the shows were good   particularly Mickey the Magician.Not so good points  what's the point in having rules if they're not enforced?! People were openly smoking in the park (not in the designated areas) which was horrid to smell. Selfie sticks are supposed to be banned but we saw plenty of these too.  they have a paper fast pass system rather than the online one at WDW. So if you're not by the ride asap, you run the risk of all fast passes being gone for the day by early morning. You're then subject to ridiculously long queues...  you can only use fast passes on a handful of rides. Crush's Coaster could really do with one as there was never less than an 80 min wait which us just insane with two young kids.  people took buggies into the open air shows which a) took up room and b) blocked viewing! Why staff didn't ensure all buggies were left to the side is beyond me.  the rides for Snow White and Pinocchio were so boring, outdated and ridiculously dark. Snow White barely even featured in her ride!! Nautilus was another pointless experience. They could scrap these and put some decent rides in!  staff really look like they hate their jobs!! Plus they seemed really thin on the ground   perhaps that's why the first point about rules not being enforced occurs.  there doesn't seem to be that many character meet and greets available, particularly princesses. The ones that are in existence have no fast passes available and are badly managed.   we didn't choose the photo pass option and we're pleased about this when we realised the lack of official photographers. Most of the meet and greets don't have them so if you want a whole family picture, you have to rely on the character helper being able to take a decent picture with your phone...not always successful!Overall it's not as well run as Florida in the slightest. The kids still enjoy it of course but the ridiculously long queues, not much choice of shows or truly great rides means it's not quite as magical as we'd hoped. Such a shame as if it was great then we'd have no hesitation coming on a regular basis but honestly, we'd rather save up and go to Florida again.\n",

      "Having been to Disneyworld Orlando four time with my children many years ago that experience gave me a lifetime of memories. This year in May 2015 I decided with my wife to take my granddaughter to Disneyland Paris. I went for six days, five nights and paid for the premium food package on full board basis. I stayed at the New York hotel within the resort. The hotel was Ok but expected more for a four star hotel. I had an early flight unfortunately and arrived at the resort at 1020 am . I was told on check in that the room was not ready till 3 pm. Not good when you have a four year old who has been up and travelling since 4am. In most hotels in Europe rooms are usually available at mid day. I noticed that the tiles in the bathroom were cracked along the bottom by the floor and the beds were like sleeping on wooden pallets. The Disney parks were a let down, seven of the rides in both parks were broken (this you are not told before you book or arrive at location) The park was somewhat dirty and even though you saw cleaning staff around they were more interested in walking in three's and fours,talking,smoking and basically not doing what they were paid to do. The plants and shrubs and supposedly manicured areas were un kept. The buildings of the rides looked tired with worn out paint. The majority of staff were polite but I found that on some of the rides for children like the Rocket, Dumbo, mad hatters rides the more the queue's the less time you had to ride . It appeared that because of the queues one or two of the rides lasted only 1min 10sec.This park is very different to the USA parks, This park is very small and you can get round comfortably in about 2 and a half days. We queued for some 2hours forty minutes to get a picture and signature from one of the princesses. It was almost that for the other characters.You had to queue at 1030 in the morn to get a ticket for the princess pavilion but were then told your child could only see one and not any of the the others. The queues for other rides were deceptive it would say 5 mins when it fact it was 40 minutes when you passed the gate. How do you tell a child they cant go on it. Thank god she was an angel throughout the whole trip and we queued where necessary. People may say I'm just complaining but when you go to the US parks you kind of expect DISNEY to provide at least the same or similar don't you?. I must mention the meal plans. These are cruelly deceptive. I went for a full board premium plan and was told I could eat what I wanted from the menu and in any restaurant within the Disney resort I wanted. Not if you don't have a reservation!!!!!!! How can you reserve for a four year old. The premium plan allows you to choose from the al acarte menu but in some of the restaurants they have the premium plan menu, two starters, three main and three deserts to choose from wow!! All this for 125 euro ( $160) per meal for three. A meal for three could cost you as much as $200 plus If you don't buy the meal plans. There are other lower plans but the food is just as bad. Didn't know my child would be restricted to froi gras or smoked salmon. I expected far more choice for what I paid. This they don't tell you when you book your holiday!!!! I was told that the premier restaurants was the California grill in the Disneyland hotel . Two things to say about that, bad, cold food, very poor service. The character meals they sell, you expect to see a lot of them there we saw four character at one meal and three princesses at another and we had to wait over an hour to see the first princess and drank water waiting for the others as we had already eaten our meal. When I got fed up with the rubbish food I went to a deli who stated that she would not take my voucher for a cheese and ham sandwich. Eventually a manage from Walts restaurant kindly helped us out an the voucher was accepted. We ate at the Lucky nugget, they took our vouchers and explained that we would lose money by eating there we understood but had a great burger. I will say go the the Buffalo Bill dinner show that was the best!!!The trip overall was disappointing considering the cost we paid. In hindsight I would have taken her to the USA for that little extra. Don't get the premium plans there not worth it.!!!!! All in all my grand daughter had a great time and we made it as best we could but I will not go back there and would advise others to think about it before going to DISNEYLAND PARIS. I think finally that the CEO's of Disney need to get out there and sort this out. I'd have sacked a few of those bosses by now!!! Rant over\n",

      "It took us a long time to save for this holiday and kids and ourselves were super excited after looking at all the advertising etc we went for 5 days and stayed in the New York Hotel. The Hotel was nice, clean and tidy. We really appreciated the free wifi! However, I don't feel staying in a Disney hotel added to the overall experience. There was one character there a day to meet and have your picture with, but at that point we were already in the park.Apart from that there was nothing else to make it special. Breakfast was good with a large selection that pleased both the adults and children. The location to the park is ideal definitely within walking distance.In the park itself the queues were very long, which is to be expected but we did take advantage of the extra 2 hours for hotel guests, this meant the important rides were covered. It was also worth using the fast pass facility which is a brilliant idea.One of the things that really disappointed us were the lack of Disney characters present. Occasionally they appeared in a pre designated place and you had the option to queue to meet them. But they weren't wandering around. My children didn't actually get to meet any characters. Sorry they did meet a princess, in the Disney Princess meet and greet. However, after 40 minutes of queuing for a ticket for this experience we were told the children could only meet one princess and they would have no choice which one. We then had to queue for about another 40 minutes before eventually getting to the front, which was very awkward when my daughter got Belle, a princess she doesn't particularly like. It certainly wasn't worth the overall 1 hour 30 minutes queue time.The parade and evening fireworks are well worth a watch but again be prepared to sit around waiting just so you can secure a descent spot.Unfortunately a lot of the narrative on the rides was in french, so most of the time we had no idea what was going on. I would recommend for any family to take snacks and drinks, as the food is extortionate. We ended up taking a trip to the local super market because it was far far cheaper than eating in the park. We enjoyed most of the rides and in 5 days pretty much covered what we wanted to. The children had fun but by the end were tired of the walking and waiting. Overall I don't feel it was the magical experience they claim, the children spent a lot of time bored because of queues and there was nothing to entertain them. I really wish that we had taken them to Alton Towers for the day and saved ourselves an awful lot of money.\n",

      "Just came back from Disneyland Paris. We stayed at the New York Hotel, Feb 12 15. The hotel itself is ok. I found the bed and pillows rather hard and we were unable to turn down the heat. However, opening the windows did help a little. The tub is very high and you need to be careful getting in and out. Breakfast is a joke. Runny power eggs, over salted bacon, and no orange juice. You will be ok if you like yogurt and rolls. The bar is overpriced, 10 euros for a cosmopolitain and 9 eurs for a single shot of whiskey. Both parks were very crowded and the staff couldn't keep up with it. We were turned away from using our Tower of Terror fastpass and told to stand in line. We are still unsure as to why because we arrived during our timeframe. All fastpasses were gone very early in the day. The average wait during our stay for rides was at least an hour. They also had several  technical difficulties  in both parks. We were stuck on Crushes Coaster for 15 mins and Rock N Rollarcoaster broke down for about 10 mins. The early morning hours are a waste. Peter Pan, the only ride open in Fantasyland, wasn't working. We had to go to Discoveryland and ride Space Mountain and Buzz Lightyear. We had dinner at Walt's in Disneyland Park and we feel that is very overated. The food is average, there isn't much choice, the steaks came out like leather and we felt very rushed. Overall, we will not return to Disneyland Paris. We feel that it is overpriced for what you get. The best part of the trip was Planet Hollywood in Disney Village but at 8.50 euros a drink, even that was too expensive.\n",

      "Disneyland Paris looks like a Disneypark   but make no mistake, it itsn't. For a start, most of the rides on our visit was closed   or closed down while we were waiting (for over an hour on several rides). The park looks tired, in dire need of fresh paint and TLC. The staff is not what you'd expect from an expensive, Disney branded park. Most of them lacking language skills or just being rude. In the best case, totally uninterested in your presence. We stayed at the New York hotel, and found the room to be small, with cigarette marks on the furniture, staind carpet and dirty wall paper. Check in staff didn't speak English.. and WiFi is extra. Not what I expect from a 'deluxe hotel'.Avoid the restaurant Parkside. The staff was so uninterested in our business that we (2 adults, 2 children) left without ordering (which nobody noticed)If you can afford it, go to Florida or California. And if you are Disney: Change the management or close the park. I'm sorry to sound so negative, but the highlight of our 2 day visit was McDonalds and the nearby village.\n",

      "i booked a three day package to stay in the Disney New York hotel for two nights, which includes three day park ticket for myself, my husband and two children (10 and 12).I decided to stay in a Disney hotel as the adverts clearly stated that you got access to the parks before the general public and I thought the extra cost would be worth avoiding the queues for at least some of the bigger rides.. BEWARE. Only the Magic Kingdom was opened early (NOT Disney Studios) and non of the large rides are open.. In fact, I was not aware of any of the rides being open, although with children older than toddlers, we did not check the Tea cups or dumbo ride. Truly disappointing!We also had food included and this too was very disappointing. The restaurants seemed ok when we first arrived, but following almost 30 minutes of waiting to be served (even a drink), we soon realised that it would be over an hour before we would eat. I would however say that the ratatouille restaurant was worth a visit, by far the best service and perhaps the better food.. All of the food is mass catered so don't expect much regardless of the restaurant name (I.e planet Hollywood).The hotels are very simple but New York is a great location (it will however take you a minimum of half an hour to check in, and that is with no queue.. No obvious reason why). The whole experience was so poor in the end, we did not bother using our 3rd days ticket. It is such a miserable place, the staff look depressed and even when we wanted to get our photos taken, the photographer on one of the rides was too busy on her phone to bother (unusual for theme park to not try and sell photos)... Everything is dated and just plain miserable, even the Rats!!... Yep, real rats, running around at dusk.. Although the sight of these were perhaps the highlight of this trip for me..as they looked like they were having more fun than anyone working there.. I guess I expected something similar to America.. You certainly can't compare!! This was my third time to this park since it first opened and it has progressively got worse...I will never go back again!! \n",

      "I recently went to Euro Disney Paris with the family. We decided it was probably our last family holiday together and that there was enough for two grown children and their parents to enjoy the time together as well enjoying time apart.The park itself although still true to Disney seemed to lack the magic it had the first time we went.Things are starting to look a bit tired and in need of some work.There were many of the bigger attractions closed for renovation which of course made other things busier than normal.As is usual with these places the food was awful, nothing was fresh and very very expensive.We stayed in the New York hotel which looked amazing on first glance but the rooms are looking a bit shabby, the pool really needs up dating and breakfast was a shambles.There seem to be far to many shops selling over priced Disney tat. The entire place is far to commercialised and the holiday feel has gone.Sad, so in answer to my heading......... no, unfortuneately I wouldn't go back\n",
